# DSA-Practice
This is a repository where we add week-wise records of DSA practice problems and their solutions. 
For each week, create a branch in this format: YOUR_NAME-WEEK-01
** Please do add the problem statement as a comment to the source code, at the top **
** Make the code as readable as possible, so that if we go through it after sometime, we could quickly understand the approach used. **
